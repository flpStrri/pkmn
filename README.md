## Does the color complexity of Pokémon change through the generations?
This analysis tries to find out.

Current data:
* Sprites from Black/White (futurely, main image from Bulbapedia could be used) 
* `pokemon.csv` (from Kaggle) is mainly used for determining the Generation of the Pokémon

Current simplifying assumptions:
* The chosen image is male, front, non-shiny 
* For Pokémon with multiple forms, only the first one (on the csv order) is used
